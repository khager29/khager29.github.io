                            <li>"During the Florida project, when the writing team needed digital interactives for a new
                                lesson, you were quick to respond and help. You created two amazing, quality digital
                                interactives that were exactly what we needed to bring the lesson to life for students.
                                You
                                completed the interactives in a short amount of time, which helped us to stay on track
                                with
                                the quick pace of the Florida project. I appreciate that you asked questions and offered
                                suggestions during the design process. You also offered naming suggestions, which helped
                                me
                                understand how to refer to each digital interactive in the written lesson. Your
                                dedication
                                to the team and to creating creative, high quality materials for students is very

                                    chaos as we all learned the process and our roles but you took feedback from all
                                    directions and merged them into a fabulous interactive.
                                    I also want to thank you for your patience as our team learns how to best serve
                                    DIDs.
