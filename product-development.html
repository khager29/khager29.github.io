                                    stated,
                                    she is a really good teacher who understands digital learning and can code it.
                                    Wow.

                                    Kim has really high standards for her work, and it is clear that she sees

                                    lever to make excellent work products. I appreciate that when Kim is building,
                                    she
                                    is

                                    As stated in the previous bullet point, Kim has high standards for herself and

                                    products. I know that Kim will continue to improve as a DID because it is
                                    evident
                                    that
                                    she
                                    has
                                    the mindset that her work products can always be improved. People who have this
                                    mindset
                                    seek
