      Kim,
      Now that the A&E Charter has ended, I wanted to take a moment to provide feedback. Your input was integral to the
      success of the Authentic Contexts prototype. The team truly depended on your expertise in the digital platform to
      help bring the vision of seamless integration to life. As part of this prototype team, you demonstrated the EM
      core
      value
      of curiosity: “We seek or create new learning opportunities for ourselves, trusting our team as we try new
      approaches.” While creating the prototype, the team had to grapple with the uncertainty of whether we should be
      experimenting. This was difficult at times, but it helped our entire team unite around the understanding that
      authentic contexts will require authentic authors. I believe we successfully shared this message with our leaders
      and colleagues. Your leadership on this prototype helped the committee accomplish our goals for the Charter: to
      help
      other see what culturally responsive Eureka Math products could look like. Thank you for that and for supporting
      my
      growth
      as I adjusted to my role as committee lead.

      In general, I have learned so much from our conversations over the past year. The important topics you have
      elevated
      will have lasting impacts. You’ve truly helped to build knowledge within our staff and I’m excited for the math
      teams’ future as we focus more on equity and access. I’m so glad we had this opportunity to work together and hope
      to
      collaborate on future projects.

      Hi Kim,
      I thought the pitch meeting was great. Despite being nervous, you presented the lesson at a nice pace, leaving
      time
      for us to process and ask questions. I appreciate that you took notes to consider as you draft the storyboard. I
      think
      the level of detail you provided was great. I know very little about digital photography and was able to visualize
      what teachers and students would experience. From a "delivery of a pitch meeting" perspective, I cannot offhand
      think
      of a push for you.

      One push regarding planning is to reach out if the map is too vague. It sounded as though we were a bit vague in
      explaining the interplay between the characteristics of univariate data distributions and the digital photography
      context. I think and hope questions were resolved during the pitch meeting, but I could see vagueness in the map
      as
      being a potential hindrance to drafting. Moving forward, if you have queries about the ideas in the map, please
      feel
      free to reach out to MEs or SMEs for clarification. And we will push to improve our maps by being less vague with
      suggestions.


      I really enjoyed the meeting and look forward to reviewing the lesson draft soon.
    </p>
    <p class="advocacy curiosity" id="06222022" from="cody-waters">
      Howdy Kim! Thanks for reaching out.

      I'll say that it's tough to give specific pushes relating to technical and/or writing projects, as our work hasn't
      been coinciding much these days. But from the projected code we'd looked at, it seems that your use of declared
      variables, ternary operators, and helper functions are all helpful in making the code readable and moving the
      project
      forward. That's quality work product!

      One observation I have made is that you continue to be quick to the punch with developing solutions for the team
      and
      helping with debugging. Often, late in a day with lots of meetings, I'll revisit a "this is broken" ping and find
      that
      it's now a "Kim helped me solve this." That aligns well with an aspect of curiosity: "explores and uncovers new
      possibilities." Keep up that great work!

      In terms of pushes, nothing comes to mind right now. If it seems helpful to lend an extra eyeball to your
      interpersonal interactions during meetings or to tech/writing work, I'm happy to help.

      Hi Kim!

      I wanted to take some time to give you feedback on how you have demonstrated the core value of enlightenment
      recently
      – specifically how you “value collective wisdom and opportunities for thought partnership”.

      In the past month, you found opportunities for us to work together to try to make infinite draggers keyboard
      operable.
      You asked me to investigate two applets because you knew this type of work is interesting to me. On each occasion,
      you
      gave me space to think things through on my own and were also available to collaborate and help me with questions.
      While the work might have been completed much more quickly on your own, I appreciate the chance to productively
      struggle with how to code these interactions and also to thought partner with you about which interaction patterns
      are
      best for students in different scenarios.

      I look forward to tackling more of these tasks together in the future!
    </p>

      Hi Kim,
      Thanks for the request for feedback. I've been trying to give more feedback as it is, and you were on my list of
      potential folks - so thanks for the push! :) I have a push for you that I think will be useful to you as you
      clearly
      have a desire do grow and continually improve in our role as DIDs. I also have a combo of great behaviors I see
      you
      exemplify frequently, with some specific examples to help clarify.
      A push.
      Advocacy: I think you actually practice advocacy in MANY other situations (accessibility, race work with A&E,
      etc.),
      so take this with a grain of salt. I have noticed that when a question is asked during a call, you tend to be
      quick
      to
      give the answer or offer a potential solution - which is good! However, as we are incorporating new members to our
      team, perhaps consider giving wait time before doing so.
      I think this could be beneficial in two ways. First, we have had discussions on our team about not being
      intimidating,
      and immediately giving an answer can work against that at times. Second, if it is something that a newer DID might
      know the answer to, or be able to come up with a potential solution, giving them some think time and time to
      respond
      might foster their own growth and help them to see ways that they can valuably contribute to our team. In other
      words,
      by holding your answer for a bit, others who needed more time to think through a solution can come up with
      something;
      then, if no one does (or if they offer a different idea), you can still provide your answer as well.
      (By the way, I've noticed that I do this as well and it's something I'm starting to work on myself, so don't think
      you're alone in this! When we know something or have a solution to offer, we want to offer it because we're
      excited
      to
      help! But I think we want to give those same opportunities to our newer DIDs too, if that makes sense.)

      A praise.
      Enlightenosity (Enlightenment/Curiosity combo, working in tandem): I frequently observe you take on challenging
      technical problems and look to find a solution. You have a great way of breaking down a problem into sizable
      steps,
      something that I feel like I have been able to watch from you and learn, and it's something that I'm working to
      emulate (though progressing still) as I think it's really effective.
      For example, when finding a bug in the code, your method of commenting out and then "reintroducing" step by step
      has
      been a great addition to my toolbox - so thanks for sharing! When working on the GGB scraper, you were embodied
      enlightenosity by going and finding a way to scrape data from the GeoGebra website. This also highlighted your
      breaking problems down into sizable steps as you determined a way to do that which no one had yet discovered, and
      thought about how we might then implement that from the scraper itself. Though it ended up not ultimately working
      due
      to cross-domain issues, having figured out that part will certainly prove useful as we push on it more later on.
      Really, you exemplify enlightenosity in many situations... so keep it up!

      I hope you find this feedback both useful and encouraging. You are an amazing teammate and I love working with you
      and
      having you on the team. If you have any questions, please let me know!
      -Levi

      Hi Kim, I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for everything you've done to help with my transition to
      the
      DID team.
      You have consistently been open and available for questions of all kinds, from technical to procedural. I
      particularly
      appreciate how you explain things in a way that meets me where I am in my understanding. You don't shy away from
      giving pushes as well as praises. Your early encouragement that I should always think about the value added by a
      digital interactive has helped shape how I understand digital lessons and has informed how I approach
      accessibility.
      You have also reached out independently of specific projects to offer interesting challenges or problems for me to
      consider as I continue learning the ropes around here.
      Thank you so much for your support! I look forward to continuing to work with you.

      Kim's contributions to the pre-k curriculum are numerous and essential to supporting students' path toward
      greatness.
      Kim collaborates with team members to create engaging digital apps that support the lesson and the development of
      mathematical concepts and language. Kim participates in the mapping process and suggests ways to incorporate
      digital
      experiences into the curriculum. Not only does she share her knowledge and expertise, she quickly creates a proof
      of
      concept to share with the writing team as they begin to develop the lessons. Most recently Kim worked to create
      digital interactives to enhance storyboard scenes, and collaborated with the video team to create a digital app to
      support a video used in the first project in Module 6. Both of these contributions significantly improve the
      learning
      experience for students by supporting contexts and engaging students in the math.
      Kim also actively collaborates with writers to further develop or adjust the applet to meet the needs of the
      students
      or the lesson. Also, she has supported the team's development of math pasts and artwork by collaborating with John
      and
      the leadership team to make suggestions, such as the pan flute and ancient dance math past and the artwork in
      multiple
      modules. Kim has also stepped in to help with images and wording of objectives. Kim has made significant
      contributions
      to the pre-k curriculum that improve the learning experience for students and the teaching experience for
      teachers.
      She also supports the team in thinking of access and equity as we develop lessons, applets, math pasts and artwork
      ideas. I have learned a lot from working with Kim as an integral member of the pre-K team, I wish we had the same
      opportunity as we were writing EM2-Grade 2.

      I have had the pleasure of working with you on both OMO and DEI over the last several months. Truly, a sound
      argument
      could be made as to how you embody all of the values at Great Minds! I will speak to the 3 that resonate most in
      my
      collaborations with you. :)
      You exemplify the value of ADVOCACY in both the DEI and OMO projects. You care deeply about producing the very
      best
      possible products to help students learn math. You craft DIs that help students see how and why the math is
      important
      in their world. You care deeply about helping teachers craft and hone their practice. This is evident in the
      comments
      you make that reflect wanting teachers to learn and grow but also giving them proper supports. You present ideas
      that
      other teammates often overlook or don't think about. This is something I value in our collaborations. I can bring
      an
      idea to the table and count on you to make a suggestion that takes it to the next level. You bring valuable ideas
      and
      unique perspectives to projects because of your vast knowledge and experience with teaching, ed tech, world
      views/knowledge, and of course, mathematics. You have kept our DEI group grounded and helped me personally to
      reflect
      on new ideas and dig deeper through your knowledge about so many cultures.
      You demonstrate the core value of AMBITION by brainstorming and collaborating with teammates. You listen
      thoughtfully
      then contribute information that pushes the team to the next level. I have seen you do this repeatedly and
      consistently on both teams. You value and validate other team members contributions. You gracefully and tactfully
      drop
      bits of knowledge that get us thinking deeper and make the products richer. You also take charge when our group is
      "spinning" and trying to figure out what direction to go. You make wise recommendations to help us move on to
      "what's
      next."

      You demonstrate the core value of CHALLENGE as you think about how students will interact with DIs and present
      alternatives to lesson writers to help them think about the best methods. You provide unique insight into learning
      and
      teaching based on your experience. During the DEI project, you have made comments about how something could be
      made
      better or have a greater impact through the use of a video or a DI. That is a lens that the rest of us do not have
      on
      the DEI project, but you have pushed us to think more about "what's possible" for a greater impact.

      I appreciate your amazing ideas, your strong intellect, and your tactful, graceful approach to collaboration. You
      make
      everyone feel like a valued teammate. I enjoy and look forward to working with you because of all of this!

      I really enjoyed shadowing you. It was valuable to see real examples of the work you did. I also enjoyed the tasks
      you

      Hello Kim,
      Thank you so much for taking the time with me these past few days. I learned a ton and cannot wait to work on
      projects
      with you. Here are some things I've reflected on while shadowing you.
      Your amount of GeoGebra/JavaScript knowledge is super impressive! It's crazy to think that you were newest DID to
      be
      hired (besides us). I once asked Sam who was the most recent DID hired prior to the newest ones and she said you.
      My
      mind was blown. You have set the bar in the amount of knowledge one can possess in a year's time.
      I appreciated seeing your "struggle." I put struggle in quotes because you really didn't struggle. In my mind,
      because
      you are all knowing Kim, I thought that you would sit down with a GeoGebra applet and just create away, knowing
      every
      step of what you wanted to create. But while watching you, you had the same questions I do while creating an
      applet,
      "if I want this to populate at this time, what condition do I need to set?" or "If I want the driveway to wrap
      around,
      what corner should I be using in my statement?" So it was comforting to me to know that no one has all the answers
      to
      a build when they are creating something.

    </p>
    <p class="challenge" id="03222022" from="michelle-libersat">
      Hi Kim! Sorry it's taken me a while to give you this feedback. While shadowing you, I appreciate the time you took
      to
      help me grow in my knowledge of GeoGebra and JavaScript. When we encountered a new GGB command or line of code you
      helped me break down what each part meant. You challenged me by allowing me to help develop an applet used for
      PreK.
      It was interesting to see each of our different takes on developing the applet. I appreciated your in-the-moment
      feedback when you mentioned that us talking through our different methods helped stretch your thinking, since we
      had
      different approaches. It helped me feel confident to share my ideas and stretch my own thinking as well.
      Additionally, the advice you gave me about thinking-aloud (or rubber ducking) was good to hear. I tend to talk to
      myself anyway, so it's good to know that this is actually an encouraged best-practice!
      In future shadowing sessions I hope that you will continue to challenge us new hires in the “no pressure” way that
      you
      did with me. It took some weight off knowing that there were no expectations for me to know how to do anything
      specific at this point but that the tasks you gave me were meant to be a challenge. Communicating that with me
      before
      I began the challenges went a long way to take the pressure off and helped me focus on the learning.

      Kim, your contributions on the A&E Team embody our core value of Ambition. In our Curriculum Review teams' quest
      to
      create products that engage, teach, and inspire students we have come across many barriers. One of the biggest
      barriers has been trying to show what authentic contexts could "look like" without having the necessary staff and
      resources in place to do so. You removed obstacles by moving ahead with the research, despite this barrier, and
      putting together a prototype that helped our team see the vision. You acknowledged that the conditions were not
      ideal,
      but also recognized that if our team didn't make an attempt to illustrate culturally responsive contexts, it
      likely
      wouldn't get done. You also helped the team move forward, ensuring we a_chieved the expectations set for the
      assignment,_ by making a checklist of tasks to be accomplished and keeping the team on track at a pivotal time
      Additionally, there are so many other ways that you contribute to this team:
      you volunteer to take on tasks
      you share helpful resources as you come across them
      you share knowledge and perspectives that elevate our discussions
      you make connections to how digital elements can enhance the work
      It has been great to learn alongside you on this team.

      One push I have for you is to continue to take initiative on our team. We are all out of our element a bit since
      we
      not in our traditional EM "roles." Although Digital Interactives Developer is your primary role, on this team we
      are
      all bringing different strengths, interests, etc. and learning from one another. I always learn something or
      consider
      something from a new perspective when I listen to your thoughts as we have discussions around this work.

      Thank you for committing to this team and working through the barriers with a growth mindset!

      Thank you for welcoming me into your world and letting me shadow you the past three days. Over this time, you
      provided
      me with challenges, guidance, and opportunities to learn more about the PK-5 world. Right off the bat, you were
      ready
      to go with a task for me that involved replicating a “scene” for a PK applet. I appreciated how you asked me
      whether
      I
      wanted to try it on my own first or if I wanted to walk through it together. Even though I opted to try it on my
      own,
      you checked in frequently and were there to support when I had questions.

      Once that work was finished, you provided me with additional challenges to extend my learning of both GeoGebra and
      JavaScript. When I asked about condensing the code, you were up for the challenge. I appreciated how you were also
      curious about how we could accomplish that and leaned into the new learning together. When I struggled with trying
      to
      do some of it on my own, you asked me questions that helped me evolve my own understanding rather than just giving
      me
      the answer. For example, when I was very determined to use a forEach method, you asked me “Do you want to run the
      code
      for each object every time one object is clicked?” This helped me understand that a forEach method was not the
      right
      avenue to take and allowed me to think through other ways to solve the problem.

      Lastly, I want to highlight the last portion of our time together as we worked to figure out why the object count
      was
      not working in the applet. You guided me through multiple ways to check to see where the issue was occurring, such
      as
      using console.log and looking in different places in the GeoGebra file. It made me realize that understanding how
      to
      fix a broken applet is just as important as learning how to create one. Thanks again for spending that time with
      me,
      and I look forward to learning more from you!

      writing team. Kim was an amazing mentor and did not shy away from challenging me to take on some of her preK
      applet
      storyboarding and creation. I joined in on the preK team meetings and experienced the development of the
      curriculum.
      Kim spent numerous hours walking me through the collaboration process and allowed me to work hands-on in Geogebra

      Hey Kim! Just wanted to stop by and give you some much overdo feedback. All of this could be said daily, but to
      officially get it in writing…

      Your work ethic is unmatched. I think relentless is a good way to describe it! There is no task you won’t take on
      with
      maximum effort, and you work until you find a solution. There are countless examples of this throughout your time
      with
      us, but a recent one is your work on sonification of applets. You recognized a need, and you unleashed your skill
      and
      drive to come up with awesome examples of its potential. This is the start of what I’m sure will be a foundational
      piece to our accessibility work down the road.


      In addition, you re-oriented your entire schedule while Ryan shadowed you last week in order to better meet his
      time
      zone. This was another above and beyond commitment that also reveals your selflessness. We can always count on you
      no
      matter what! You’re always willing to hop on a Zoom, and you’re always one of the first to respond to help others
      in
      threads in our channel and other help channels.


      Finally, I’m impressed, and not surprised, by your pursuit of Illustrator learning. You’re a constant learner and
      continuously expand your skill set for the betterment of our team and the other teams you work with. Your
      curiosity

      about the platform and the ripple effects that certain edits can make. I want to push you to keep giving feedback
      about the types of MET feedback you receive so our team can continue improving the OMO development process.


      I enjoyed our coffee break last week and I look forward to working with you more in the future.


      Thanks!

    "So if you haven't seen the prototypes, yet please go to our platform and take a look. I'm sure that you're going to
    share in my sentiment that the quality of our onscreen personas and engagement techniques in both digital and the
    video components has truly evolved to a lovely on-brand feel that mixes authenticity with polish and
    professionalism.
    So that's giving us an excellent foundation to move forward from."

    FYI, I was using that as an example to show the code needed to create the branched feedback and Jill's exact words
    were "Branched video feedback is pretty sophisticated stuff". Kudos!

    Grade 1: The wordless videos and digital interactives are being well received by the students. They are frequent
    enough that students look forward to them, but not so often that students expect them.
    Grade 4: The slides and digital interactives/videos are very popular with students and provide solid landing points
    for students that drive discussion.

    I have worked alongside Kim on the On My Own DID Prototype Project as the Content Co-Lead since September 2021. I
    would like to provide the following pushes and praises on her work from a content perspective and specifically
    related
    to her work on the 1st Grade Prototype.


    Praises:

    Kim is a unique talent in that she has robust content knowledge, EM2 curricular knowledge, experience with Eureka
    Math
    digital products, and a wealth of coding experience. Plainly stated, she is a really good teacher who understands
    digital learning and can code it. Wow. This experience has made Kim an ideal partner for our VTs, who are not
    accustomed to Digital Interactive components in our lesson products. In working with Jasmine on the 1st Grade
    prototypes, this allowed Kim to discern the essence of the lesson alongside Jasmine. In hearing Jasmine discuss how
    kids needed to interact with the math in a 1st Grade lesson, Kim was able to understand exactly what that meant from
    a
    Eureka Math perspective as well as explain and show Jasmine what she could make happen using a digital experience.
    Kim’s experience as a math teacher and coder put her in a leadership role when collaborating with Jasmine and
    allowed
    her to collaborate effectively.
    Kim has really high standards for her work, and it is clear that she sees feedback as a key lever to make excellent
    work products. I appreciate that when Kim is building, she is also active in Slack, asking content team members
    (Jasmine, John, and I), product team members (Scott), and peer DIDs (Cody) for feedback to inform several product
    perspectives. I appreciate that she is so keenly aware of all the feedback lenses through which we will need to view
    this product.
    As stated in the previous bullet point, Kim has high standards for herself and her work products. I know that Kim
    will
    continue to improve as a DID because it is evident that she has the mindset that her work products can always be
    improved. People who have this mindset seek out feedback and always view their own work with a critical eye. Kim
    came
    to 1st Grade working meetings with notes that stated what the digital product could do at the time, what it would do
    when it was “done,” and what she would like to do to make it better in the future. While Kim could be less hard on
    herself, she is always striving to improve.
    From a content perspective on the last Grade 1 Prototype, I would like to highlight three aspects of the prototype
    that were particularly effective and will inform the final look of OMO lessons: 1) The speech button to read DI
    directions was an effective last minute add. This feature was recognized as valuable, and we will not release any
    K/1
    (maybe K-2) products without this feature. Good work. 2) Kim was able to build a functional tool choice digital
    interactive. This was resource intensive, but it was done well. Kim’s ability to show the senior team that tool
    choice
    is possible is going to inform how CGI, counting collection, and modeling lessons are considered as we ramp up for
    production. 3) Kim was innovative when she linked Jasmine’s counting on in the teacher video to highlighting
    student’s
    modeling work. This has really sparked the conversation around the interplay between the teacher’s screen and the
    student’s screen.

    Pushes:

    Kim will be a more effective team member and collaborator if she asks questions to clarify project asks and names
    project feedback in a timely manner. There were instances during the G1 prototype when feedback regarding the
    clarity
    of the project asks and feedback regarding the workload of the project were communicated well after Kim had
    identified
    issues. Sometimes, this feedback was communicated during end of day check-ins as obstacles while other times it was
    held and communicated at a later date. The push is to communicate feedback and workload concerns during working
    meetings, such as the 12 PM daily working meeting, or to reach out to one of the project co-leads. The honest
    impacts
    of holding feedback are that Kim was sometimes frustrated with the work, other team members continued
    working/planning
    without essential information, and team communication/culture was strained.
    As the prototype and OMO work continues, Kim can hone her lens for knowing when to allow the prototype work to be
    less
    defined and when team leads need to provide more clarity. Kim provided solid feedback when she asked for role
    definition, a specific ask, and goals at the onset of each prototype. This is an instance when clarity is essential.
    In contrast, when rapid prototyping, for example, there were questions about how rough/polished the lesson should
    be,
    exactly what content needed to be covered, and others. In these instances of true creativity and iteration, embrace
    the ambiguity of prototyping and produce the best work possible with the time given.

    Hi Kim,
    You've been doing a great job in the OMO prototype project.

    I'm selecting the Great Minds value of "Curiosity": Employee explores and uncovers new possibilities allowing us to
    adapt to an ever-changing environment. This project is unusual in GM, we are producing a lot of material for a
    variety
    of audiences: leadership, public testers, ourselves. (In contrast to EM^2 where we were focused on final production)
    I
    want to be clear that the work products you're creating are valuable and you're doing good work.

    Praises:

    you've generated and adapted robust manipulatives for each of the prototypes. both standard models (area, PVC,
    number
    path, etc) and custom (pizza slicer).
    further, you've been able to branch them for specific uses on slides, or branch from the existing uses as teacher
    demos. For example, the G4 area model and PVC chart has separate functionality depending on the slide.
    The documentation and organization of your materials has aided collaboration, as Levi was able to hit the ground
    running from your Number Path applet.

    Pushes:

    Continue to track and advocate for your time. Or, in short, don't work overtime. It's perfectly fine to say "hmm I
    estimate that new task will take 10 hours which would push me out to Wednesday." (then the asker can act upon that
    information) Especially during a project like this, we need to figure out if it scales up to a workable production
    process, so it may mean that we extend timelines, or change the task to a smaller scope.
    This is more of a just-in-case message: You can think of all of your work product as valuable, even if edits or a
    change in direction is made. Now, I certainly understand you would like more communication about why changes are
    made
    and that's valid. A push for me!

    More praise because let's head into the weekend on a high note

    You've been a source of learning for other GM team members that are unfamiliar with the world of possibilities that
    the digital medium opens up. Keep this up especially! The VT team and managers are really learning a lot here.
    </p>

    I have enjoyed learning alongside you on the Access & Equity Committee. As a member of the committee, you are
    demonstrating our GM core value challenge. As you evaluate the curriculum and make recommendations for improvement,
    you are exemplifying one of the behaviors that our team strives for related to this value. Specifically, you
    identify
    new ways to make products more accessible, engaging, coherent, and equitable. I’m excited for the future of EM
    products and services as a result of the teams' efforts.

    I also appreciate you taking on additional responsibilities when needed, a behavior indicative of our core value
    ambition. You enthusiastically took on the task of team notetaker numerous times during our committee check in
    meetings. You also graciously accepted the role of data guru for our team. I am personally grateful for your help.
    On
    a larger scale, your willingness to step up has benefitted the entire committee. Your commitment to the team and
    this
    work is so appreciated.

    I look forward to your continued input on our committee.

    Best,
    Maureen

    I have had the opportunity to work with Kim during the Grade 1 On My Own prototype of digital interactives. From the
    moment I met Kim I very much appreciate it how she saw me as a human first. We were able to have very effective and
    productive meetings because we created space for each other to share ideas and provide feedback in a way that was
    respectful but pushed the ideas forward. Kim expemplifies many of our company's core values including but not
    limited
    to:

    Advocacy
    Specifically, during our meetings, Kim made sure to keep students and "choice" front and center by advocating for
    tool
    choice as the main part of our second prototype. She also worked hard to produce a game in the first iteration that
    provided students with ample opportunity to engage in unguided learning through exploration.
    Kim exemplifies leadership and did a great job advocating for time for her and me to work alone to really get on the
    same page. Though I was not a part of the first prototype with grade 4, I feel as if Kim took the lessons she
    learned
    from the first iteration and set us up for success.

    Curiosity/Challenge
    Kim and I had extensive meetings where we took turns leading the work. In each, we allowed the other space to take
    the
    reigns while always keeping students and their experience front and center. When our work was virtual teacher-led,
    Kim
    came prepared to ask the right questions and we got on the same page immediately. She was able to carry out the
    vision
    I had for the lesson as well as improve upon the ideas. When it was her turn to lead, she made sure that shift was
    clear and did a great job of allowing the digital interactives to shine. She taught me how to let the VT be an
    auxiliary piece that supports the learning but isn't the learning in and of itself. The result was 2 efficiently
    created and effectively executed prototypes in the course of 1 week.

    On top of all of this, Kim is just a brilliant, quick-witted, wonderful person to work alongside and I have had a
    blast learning from her and seeing the magic she can create.
