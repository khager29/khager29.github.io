                                    brought up, you talked through what might
                                    happen if we implemented each idea and
                                    highlighted possible unintended results. As
                                    the group was spiraling around different
                                    possible locations in the code to call the
                                    updateKeyboardInstructions function, you
                                    encouraged the group to consider what events
                                    are fired during the clicking of a button
                                    and in what order. Together, the group
                                    continued to make headway against the
                                    problem. [Challenge: "gives voice to new and

                                    coding skills are so beyond mine. I love
                                    that you are quick to help others and are
                                    very good at explaining how the code works
                                    when you are helping. The one thing I would
                                    say you could improve on is that you could
                                    do more sharing out of what you are working
                                    on. I am sure you are doing amazing things
                                    every day and I would love to see it (so I
                                    can steal your coding and build methods :p ,
                                    I mean so I can learn more from you. )”

                                    away from challenging me to take on some of
                                    her preK applet storyboarding and creation.
                                    I joined in on the preK team meetings and
                                    experienced the development of the
                                    curriculum. Kim spent numerous hours walking
                                    me through the collaboration process and
                                    allowed me to work hands-on in Geogebra to
                                    create an applet that would be used in the
                                    preK curriculum. Her teaching skills shined
                                    as she created an amazing learning
                                    environment. By the end of the 3 days of
                                    shadowing, my confidence level working with
                                    JS and Geogebra increased greatly. She was
                                    an amazing mentor and I'm excited to
                                    continue working with her in the future.”
