                                    we have come
                                    across many barriers. One of the biggest barriers has been trying to show what
                                    authentic
                                    contexts could "look like" without having the necessary staff and resources in

                                    and putting

                                    were not ideal, but also recognized that if our team didn't make an attempt to
                                    illustrate
                                    culturally responsive contexts, it likely wouldn't get done. You also helped the

                                    times during our committee check in meetings. You also graciously accepted the
                                    role of data guru
                                    for our team. I am personally grateful for your help. On a larger scale, your
                                    willingness to
                                    step up has benefitted the entire committee. Your commitment to the team and
                                    this work is so
                                    appreciated.‚Äù
