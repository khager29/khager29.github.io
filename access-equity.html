                                    we have come
                                    across many barriers. One of the biggest barriers has been trying to show what
                                    authentic
                                    contexts could "look like" without having the necessary staff and resources in
                                    place to do so.
                                    You removed obstacles by moving ahead with the research, despite this barrier,
                                    and putting
                                    together a prototype that helped our team see the vision. You acknowledged that
                                    the conditions
                                    were not ideal, but also recognized that if our team didn't make an attempt to
                                    illustrate
                                    culturally responsive contexts, it likely wouldn't get done. You also helped the

                                    forward, ensuring we achieved the expectations set for the assignment, by making
                                    a checklist of
                                    tasks to be accomplished and keeping the team on track at a pivotal time

                                    so many other ways that you contribute to this team:
